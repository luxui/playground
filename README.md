# LuxUI Demo

This repository is a demo application for [LuxUI].

## Setup

Pretty standard stuff:

  1. `git clone`
  2. `npm install`
  3. `npm run server`
  4. `npm start`

## Demo

There are two main areas of change to illustrate LuxUI: `server/api.js` and
`src/index.js`; there are corresponding, and progressive, example code in the
[`demo`] directory.

The example files in [`demo`] follow the numbering in
[`demo/demo.md`](demo/demo.md#outline) under "Outline".
